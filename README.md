# Rockets
The goal of this project is to collaborate on designs of rockets and rocket components for 3D printing.

The first set of designs were developed in [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/). Using OpenSCAD requires some basic programming skills and it is helpful to have some knowledge of basic math and trigonometry. That said, it is esay to llok at exsiting designs, make tweaks and assemble them into new rockets without knowing any math.

People are encourged to join and add designs with other tools. As we elarn more togther we will figure out the best tools to use for different projects and skills. 

We want rocket designs to be safe and sound and to follow stanard rocket design rules. So we also encourgae contributors to provide documentation about how parts were stress tested and OpenRocket model/simulation results as well as real field test results.
