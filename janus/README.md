# Janus

This rocket has been designed so parts can be replaced and assembled without the use of glue. A [blue tube](https://www.alwaysreadyrocketry.com/) is recommended to insulate the motor from the rocket motor support tube.If you use other tubes, you will need to adjust the paper_tube_wall_thickness setting accordingly.

The script for making threads (screws) was copied from [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:900137). Make sure to keep the header intact and give proper attribution.
